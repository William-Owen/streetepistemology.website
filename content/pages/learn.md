## Introduction

Street Epistemology is about having a conversations that help others honestly reflect on the ideas they hold. Specifically, it is about encouraging reflection on their Epistemology; the reasons and methods they have used to arrive at knowledge.

There are many ways of having conversations that achieve this goal; but we would strongly recommend learning a number of core principles, and techniques. Understanding of these principles will help you get started.

## Basic principles

1. **Rapport**: Remain friendly, polite and respectful. Take the time to make sure you conversation partner is comfortable check in regularly.
1. **Collaborate**: Conversations should not have winners and losers; you are working together to understand and reflect.
1. **Listen**: Pay close attention to what is said and make sure that your conversation partner knows they are being heard.
1. **Empathy**: Everyone comes to a conversation with different perspectives and expediences. Notice that you may not agree but that doesn't mean
1. **Question**: Ask don't tell; avoid the temptation to correct, explain or injecting your own perspective.
1. **Progress**: The goal should be to induce reflection, not win or convert. Don't push to 'close the deal' or allow the person you are speaking to the time to walk away and think about things in their own time. Remember that in the moment progress can look like failure
