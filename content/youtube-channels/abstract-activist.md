The goal of SE is not necessarily to change a belief, but to exercise and explore good reasoning for how we know what we know. Is it possible to resolve differences of belief without debate? Are we open minded to the idea that we are close minded? What would it take to change our minds?

I am an amateur philosopher. I can be wrong about my beliefs and would be happy to discover that I am. I encourage my viewers to consider this approach the next time we misunderstand or disagree with someone.Please consider multiple examples of this Conversation style before making a final judgment about it.
