I record short interviews I have with random people about what they believe and why. I use an approach called Street Epistemology to engage in meaningful, civil, and productive conversations about their deeply held beliefs.

My goal in these talks, at minimum, is to have a respectful conversation, and genuinely listen and consider everything that is being said. Additionally if I can help people to discover why they believe what they believe, and ask questions that they may have never thought about, or if I can help someone discover a method they use is unreliable, as well as encourage them to find better methods, that would be great.

If you enjoyed the talks please share and subscribe to my channel. You can also follow me on Facebook & Twitter.
