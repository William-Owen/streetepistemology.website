Hello, I'm Ty, and I'm working on a way  to talk to anyone about anything.

I set up a table in public spaces (campuses, parks, etc.) and have short chats with absolute strangers about whatever means a lot to them!  Often, these include subjects such as race, politics and religion--and the main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to have friendly, productive, and meaningful face-to-face conversations about these sensitive issues.
