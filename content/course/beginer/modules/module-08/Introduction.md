Have you ever wanted to have a meaningful conversation with someone about their deeply held belief, but, try as you might, it always ends in an argument, or worse, awkward silence? Why does this happen? Why does it seem that there are so many ways for the conversation to veer into a ditch? While there are several potential reasons for this dynamic, one of the first places to look is a lack of rapport built between you and your interlocutor.

Rapport is an attitude or atmosphere between people that signals a friendly, harmonious relationship. Signs that rapport exists for example can be understanding, respect, and flowing communication. You can also think about it as “good vibes”. This aspect is crucial for conducting effective SE conversations. If rapport is maintained, it can provide a context in which your interlocutor feels safe to re-examine their beliefs and honestly report whether their confidence in a belief has changed, given the merits of their reasons. If rapport is not built or maintained with your interlocutor, the conversation will likely end in an argument, or end awkwardly.

Let's look at an example of such a conversation that lacks rapport. Here, Jackson is a new SE practitioner having a conversation with his school bus driver, Sarah.
