<dialogue>
<direction>Jackson boards the bus and sits down behind the school bus driver</direction>
<actor name="Jackson">Hey, Ms. Sarah. How's it going today?<actor>
<actor name="Sarah">Good morning Jackson. Smooth sailing, thanks to my lucky pendant here.</actor>
<direction>Sarah touches necklace</direction>
<actor name="Jackson">Yeah, right.</actor>
<direction>pulls out cell phone</direction>
<actor name="Sarah">Well, it definitely works. I've been driving professionally for years and never had an issue.</actor>
<direction>Sarah smiles friendly</direction>
<actor name="Jackson" parenthetical="mutters under breath">We should mass-produce those then.</actor>
<actor name="Sarah">What's that?</actor>
<actor name="Jackson">Nothing. To be honest, I think it's a superstition. Statistically speaking, I doubt there are less accidents hen drivers wear lucky pendants. And it's not that I don't like the way you drive, cause I do.</actor>
<actor name="Sarah">I don't really care about statistics, it just helps me to have this pendant when I drive.</actor>
<actor name="Jackson">Tell me why you think your pendant has magic powers that work in your favour.</actor>
<actor name="Sarah" parenthetical="jerks head back"> It's not "magic". It's the universe watching over me. And you, too.</actor>
<actor name="Jackson">That sounds like magic to me.</actor>
<actor name="Sarah">I suppose it does. For some people.</actor>
<direction>Sarah rolls eyes</direction>
<actor name="Sarah" cont>You see, all you need is...</actor>
<actor name="Jackson">A wizard?</actor>
<direction>A student in the next row stifles a laugh</direction>
<actor name="Sarah">That's not very nice.</actor>
<actor name="Jackson">I'm sorry.</actor>
<direction>Jackson looks down at phone</direction>
<actor name="Sarah">Yeah... </actor>
<direction>The bus creeps to a stop at a red light as her voice trails off, and she stares out the driverâ€™s side window</direction>

Hmm. Sarah doesn't seem so excited to talk to Jackson about her "magic" pendant any more. The school bus might be running perfectly with Sarah behind the wheel, but this conversation has completely run out of gas. What happened?

In this module, we'll examine various aspects of rapport. You will receive tools and techniques to gain the skills needed to keep your interactions non-confrontational and respectful, components necessary for effective Street Epistemology.
