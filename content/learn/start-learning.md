### Introduction

Street Epistemology is about having conversations that help others honestly reflect on the ideas they hold. Specifically, it is about encouraging reflection on their epistemology; the reasons and methods they have used to arrive at knowledge.

There are many ways of having conversations that achieve this goal; but we would recommend learning several core principles and techniques. Understanding of these principles will help keep the conversation productive and friendly, and help you avoid intuitions that can unintentionally lead the conversation astray.

### The basic principles

1. **Rapport**: Remain friendly, polite and respectful. <!-- Take the time to make sure you conversation partner is comfortable check in regularly. Aggression, frustration and other negative framing can make people feel attacked, and put them in a defensive position that makes them less likely to listen and reflect. -->
1. **Collaborate**: <!-- Conversations should not have winners and losers; you are working together to help your conversation partner honestly understand and reflect. Notice that--> You may not agree but that doesn't mean you are in opposition.
1. **Listen**: Pay close attention to what is said and make sure that your conversation partner knows they are being heard. <!--  Even when you are sure checking in often to ensure that you have heard corretly what was said not only helps avoid unintended confusion, but also allows them to hear and reflect on what they have said. Using the language and definitions of your conversation partner helps you have the conversation on their terms and makes them more comfortable.-->
1. **Empathy**: <!-- Everyone comes to a conversation with different perspectives and expediences. Always remember you may be wrong, or perhaps you are both wrong, and that being wrong feels a lot like being right.--> Most people have good motives, and we are all in different places in our never ending journey towards a better understanding.
1. **Question**: Ask don't tell; avoid the temptation to correct, explain or injecting your own perspective. <!-- Using Questions is the primary tool of Street Epistemology. Using asking honest questions about your conversation partners position you are mirroring the behaviour you wish to inspire within them.-->
1. **Progress**: The goal should be to encourage self reflection. People rarely will abandon a position during a conversation. <!-- Don't push to 'close the deal' and instead allow your conversation partner the time to walk away and think about things in their own time. Remember that in the moment real progress can look like failure.-->
