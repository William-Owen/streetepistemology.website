No. Whilst it is true the the origin of the term &#x27;Street Epistemology&#x27; was coined in a book entitled &quot;A manual for creating atheists&quot; by Peter Begissian; modern Street Epistemology is no longer explicitly a tool for addressing religious beliefs; and instead genuinely helps people explore and reflect on any epistemology.

The tools of Street Epistemology are agnostic in regards to any given position or subject; except to the extent that the position is held for poor epistemological reasons.
