No. Whilst it is true the the origin of the term "Street Epistemology" was coined in a book entitled "A Manual for Creating Atheists" by Peter Boghossian; modern Street Epistemology is no longer explicitly a tool for addressing religious beliefs. Instead genuinely helps people explore and reflect on any epistemology.

The tools of Street Epistemology are agnostic in regards to any given position or subject; except to the extent that the position is held for poor epistemological reasons.
