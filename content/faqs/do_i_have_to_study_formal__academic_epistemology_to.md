No. Formal study is unnecessary since Street Epistemology is not the application or study of epistemology, but rather a conversational technique developed to assist laypersons in having productive conversations about epistemology.

That being said, it's helpful to understand what epistemology is as well as the philosophical definitions of and distinctions between knowledge, belief, and confidence. In addition, formal study of epistemology in an academic setting may enable you to go beyond the basics of Street Epistemology to dialogue with those who are themselves studied in epistemology or to develop your own techniques for effective dialogue on the topic. So it can be beneficial to practising Street Epistemology, but it is not a requirement.
