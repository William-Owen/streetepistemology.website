The trolley problem is a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology. There are many varients of the problem that can be used to explore differnt intuitions with regards to morality; however the most basic version of the dilemma, known as "Bystander at the Switch" or "Switch", goes:

A runaway trolley is barreling down a railway track. Ahead are five people tied up and unable to move. You stand next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks; saving the five people. However, you notice that there is one person also tied to the alternate track. You have two options:

- Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
- Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.
