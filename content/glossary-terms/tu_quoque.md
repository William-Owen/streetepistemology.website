Tu quoque is an informal fallacy that intends to discredit the opponent's argument by attacking the opponent's own personal behaviour as being inconsistent with the argument's conclusion.

Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.
