A straw man is an informal fallacy where someone creates a false version of an opponents position and makes their augments against that rather than the real position. This is known as 'attacking the straw man'.

The reverse method, known as a 'Steel man' or 'Steel manning' is when someone attempts to clarify the strongest version of an opponents position before making an argument against it.
