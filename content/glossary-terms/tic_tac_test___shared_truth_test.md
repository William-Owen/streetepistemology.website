title: Tic Tac Test / Shared truth test
aka:
- Truth test
- TT
---
A thought experiment used in Street Epistemology to clarify a position on shared truth/reality.

If someone was to say there was an even number of Tic Tacs on a pack, and another person was to say they there was an odd number; they could not both be correct. A further assertion might be made to include the idea that without prior additional knowledge it is reasonable to be agnostic about any of these claims; or to have only a 50% confidence that it each statement is true. This question is useful as it affirms objective truth, and introduced the logical Law of excluded middle.
