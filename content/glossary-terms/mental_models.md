Mental models are representations of how something works that we hold in our brains. Mental models vary in complexity according to need. For example, most people will have an elementary idea of how an aeroplane works; however, a pilot's mental model will be much more sophisticated. An aeroplane designer or engineer perhaps an even more sophisticated still.
