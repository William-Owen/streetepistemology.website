title: "A priori / A posteriori"
---
'A priori' and 'a posteriori' are Latin phrases used in philosophy to distinguish types of knowledge, justification, or argument by their reliance on empirical evidence or experience.

A priori knowledge is that which is independent from experience. Examples include mathematics, tautologies, and deduction from pure reason.

A posteriori knowledge is that which depends on empirical evidence. Examples include most fields of science and aspects of personal knowledge.
