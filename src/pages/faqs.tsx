						<h2>What is Epistemology?</h2>

						<p>Epistemology (sometimes referred to as 'the theory of knowledge') is a branch of philosophy that studies of the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge. The term is derived from the Greek epistēmē (“knowledge”) and logos (“reason”).</p>

					<section id="purpose">

						<h2>Whats the difference between Epistemology and Street Epistemology?</h2>

						<p>Whilst Epistemology is the study of knowledge, Street Epistemology is about having conversations with people that encourage them to reflect on their knowledge, in the form of exploring ideas and opinions. The term 'Street' is also there to indicate this is non-academic.</p>

					</section>

					<section id="purpose">

						<h2>What is the purpose of Street Epistemology?</h2>

						<p>Street Epistemology is about inspiring people to engage in conversations, that help others honestly reflect on why they believe what they believe and the rationality of those reasons.</p>

					</section>

					<section>

						<h2>Is Street Epistemology just evangelizing for atheism?</h2>

						<p>No. Whilst it is true the the origin of the term 'Street Epistemology' was coined in a book entitled "A manual for creating atheists" by Peter Begissian; modern Street Epistemology is no longer explicitly a tool for addressing religious beliefs; and instead genuinely helps people explore and reflect on any epistemology.</p>
						<p>The tools of Street Epistemology are agnostic in regards to any given position or subject; except to the extent that the position is held for poor epistemological reasons.</p>

					</section>

					<section>

						<h2>Do  Street Epistemology conversations require flagging down strangers for interviews on camera?</h2>

						<p>No, not at all. People can get this impression because the "strangers on camera" interviews are published and shared (and unrecorded conversations are not), but it's misleading.  Street Epistemology is a tool which can be used in any conversation in just about any context.</p>

					</section>

					<section>

						<h2>My friend believes something that is likely untrue. How can I get them to change their mind?</h2>

						<p>It's great that you want to help your friend hold beliefs that align with reality. And yet it is important to try and view  Street Epistemology as a tool to explore a person's foundation for their belief--if they are willing and provide consent! If they are not ready to have this conversation, don't try to force it.</p>
						<p>Be prepared for the possibility that your friend based their belief on good reasons and a solid method. And if they didn't, try to make the discovery an exciting project that you can both embark on together.</p>
						<p>Ultimately, however, your conversation partner will be the one who may decide to lower (or raise) their confidence in their belief, or perhaps even discard it outright. Your questions may be instrumental in facilitating honest reflection, but remind yourself that people tend to change their minds when they are ready to do so; oftentimes, at some cost.</p>
						<p>These conversations and what they lead to may be painful, and they may trigger hostility in defence of the belief. If you practice  Street Epistemology with the people who are close to you, bear in mind that it may affect your relationship with them.</p>

					</section>

					<section>

						<h2>I disagree with what my conversation partner has claimed. Should I tell them?</h2>

						<p>This is an excellent and frequently-asked question in  Street Epistemology circles.</p>
						<p>It is up to the practitioner to decide how much to reveal about your position on the claim being discussed and when. Some may wish to wait until after the belief has been investigated to avoid causing a person to become defensive or uneasy. Others feel it is important to disclose one's position beforehand out a matter of respect and/or to model honesty, even if doing so could make a discussion a bit tougher to navigate.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Some  Street Epistemology-ers may offer to disclose their position after the claimant's views have been explored so as not to sway them one way or the other. If you offer to do this, make sure you follow through and reveal your views--it might even make for a good opportunity for them to question you using the same approach!</p>
						<p>Regardless of your decision, it is best to set aside your biases and views on the claim as much as possible since it is your conversation partner's position that we want to examine.</p>

					</section>

					<section>

						<h2>Do I have to study formal, academic epistemology to do  Street Epistemology?</h2>

						<p>Formal study is unnecessary since  Street Epistemology is not the application or study of epistemology, but rather a conversational technique developed to assist laypersons in having productive conversations about epistemology.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>That being said, it's very helpful to understand what epistemology is as well as the philosophical definitions of and distinctions between knowledge, belief, and confidence. In addition, formal study of epistemology in an academic setting may enable you to go beyond the basics of  Street Epistemology to dialogue with those who are themselves studied in epistemology or to develop your own techniques for effective dialogue on the topic. So it can be beneficial to practicing  Street Epistemology, but it is not a prerequirement.</p>

					</section>

						<h2>Are there reasons to prefer  Street Epistemology methods over other methods of engagement?</h2>

						<p>For example:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Directly presenting evidence which counters their belief</li>
							<li>Ridiculing their beliefs</li>
							<li>Showing them the counter-apologetics and refutations of their claims</li>
						</ul>

						<p> Street Epistemology was originally created to avoid common psychological biases which impede cordial discussions and self-examination when people feel that their deeply-held beliefs are being attacked. Whether  Street Epistemology is the "best” way to approach a given conversation will largely depend on your implicit and explicit goals, as well as the context of the conversation. It is recommended to ask yourself introspective questions such as:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>What outcomes have I obtained from each approach in past conversations, and are those the outcomes I desire here?</li>
							<li>Has my IL already made up their mind on this topic, and are they receptive to evidence which disconfirms their stance?</li>
							<li>Is it important that they enjoy the conversation, and leave the door open to future discussions on this topic?</li>
							<li>Am I currently in a professional setting, at a family gathering, on a radio call-in show, or have other special circumstances? Does the setting affect the approach I should use?</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>I'm seeing a lot of acronyms that are unfamiliar. IL, SE, and OTF - what's that all about?</h2>

						<p>Like most communities, we tend to abbreviate commonly-used words or phrases to save time. IL stand for conversation partner (your conversation partner).  Street Epistemology is short for Street Epistemology. OTF is short for John W. Loftus Outsider Test for Faith.</p>
