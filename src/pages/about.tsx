				<h1>What is Street Epistemology?</h1>

				<p><strong>No one wants to believe bad ideas,</strong> <em>...but we probably all do.</em></p>

				<p>We all want to believe as many true things, and as few false things as possible. </p>

				<p>Street Epistemology promotes the use of a friendly, non-confrontational tool that helps people reflect on what they believe and importantly, why they believe it. Encouraging someone to reflect on a belief can help people notice they might not have good reasons to believe something after all. If a person has good reasons, then the method can help strengthen confidence in that belief.</p>

				<p>Street Epistemology is in part based on the Socratic method, a dialogue between individuals, based on asking questions and stimulate critical thinking. Street Epistemology is not about promoting anyone belief over another, only reflecting on why we believe something.</p>
